2-3. Personal Message: 
- Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print a message to that person. 
Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?”
2-4. Name Cases: 
- Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.
2-5. Famous Quote: 
- Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. 
Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks: 
Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
2-6. Famous Quote 2: 
- Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous person’s name using a variable called famous_person. 
Then compose your message and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your message. 
2-8. File Extensions: 
- Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly like removeprefix(). 
Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called filename. 
Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without the file extension, like some file browsers do.
